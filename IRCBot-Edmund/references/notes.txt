
1. Self Introduction

Hi! My name is Edmund. I'm a robot messenger currently working for my boss 
Terry OY. My predecessor is Splunge, who's a good idea, but possibly not, and my 
boss Terry OY is not being indecisive. He was very immature and went wrong
several times, so my boss created me to take over his job. Currently my only 
function is to remember your chat history. If you want to leave a message to my 
boss, you can send me one privately. Have a nice day!

2. Private Reply

Thank you for your words. I'll keep it for you and my boss will ensure to get 
back to you later.

This is how you register your nickname:

1.Pick a nickname, and connect. Make sure you have a nickname that you can 
remember the next time you log in. If you want to change it after you have 
connected already, type "/nick YourNewNickname"
2.Type "/msg nickserv register YourPassword you@example.com" into the text box of 
the chat — including the slash at the beginning, and replace the password and 
email address with something you select.
3.Type /msg nickserv register YourNickName YourPassword
Every time you log in later, you will have to issue the command /msg nickserv 
identify YourNickName YourPassword before we can see what you're typing.

This situation will last until the Freenode servers have been upgraded, on 
Jan 30, 2010. We apologize for the inconvenience.
